# Tests written with ðŸƒŸJEST

Why there are two file (*.assert.js & *.test.js)? because I used esm package for implementing es6 modules (import/export) and I had to make two file; one file for test and one file for esm implementing.

I'm using a different database for testing for check full functionality of the back end without effecting the main database.
